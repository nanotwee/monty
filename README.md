# monty

MONTY is a computer simulation program based on Monte-Carlo sampling.
We aim at soft matter systems: polymers, polyelectrolyte, ions, liquids.

Main.cpp can uses different modules to model the system, propogate it, analyze and create graphs with final results.

Some examples of figures can be found in "./figs/".
Once compiled the program can be run with (default) parameters. It creates a folder and records system conformation into both visual (png-format) and text files (pdb-format).
